## Customization

### Themes

Add or edit theme variables in `css/style.css` and update `js/theme.js` to register the new theme. The theme system uses CSS custom properties for quick color swaps and smooth transitions.

### Adding Products

Extend the `products` array in `js/products.js` with new product objects. Keep structure consistent: `id, name, category, price, image, description, sizes, colors, rating, inStock, tags`.

### Internationalization

Add i18n JSON bundles and swap text strings via a small locale loader — the project structure is ready for language files.

---

## Performance & Best Practices

- **Images:** Use `loading="lazy"`, explicit width/height, and optimized sizes.
- **CSS:** Critical CSS inlined for fast FCP; non-critical styles defer-loaded.
- **JavaScript:** ES modules, event delegation, and debouncing on search/filters.
- **Metrics targets:** FCP < 1.5s, LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, FID < 100ms.

---

## Accessibility & SEO

- WCAG 2.1 AA-focused: keyboard navigation, ARIA roles, proper labels.
- Semantic HTML structure and heading hierarchy (H1 - H6) for screen reader clarity.
- JSON-LD product markup and Open Graph meta tags for rich sharing.

---

## Security Considerations

This is a front-end demo. For production, pair with a secure backend and follow these guidelines:

- Use server-side authentication and secure session cookies (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite).
- Validate and sanitize all user input server-side.
- Never store sensitive user credentials in Local Storage.
- Serve over HTTPS and implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP).

---

## Code Quality

- Modular JS with single-responsibility classes and methods
- Consistent linting and formatting (ESLint + Prettier recommended)
- Unit and integration testing: plan for Jest + Testing Library, and E2E with Cypress

---
