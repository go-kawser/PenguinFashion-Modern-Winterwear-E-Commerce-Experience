An elegant, responsive, and accessible static storefront prototype for a winterwear brand. This repository is designed to impress clients and hiring managers: polished UI, clear architecture, example workflows, and easy paths to production.

## Demo

Open `index.html` locally, or serve the project with a simple static server to experience the full UI and cart flows.

Local preview (PowerShell):

```powershell
# Quick: Python built-in HTTP server
python -m http.server 8000

# Or using npm's serve package (if you prefer Node)
npm init -y; npm install --no-save serve
npx serve -s . -l 5000

# Then open http://localhost:8000 or http://localhost:5000
```

Replace the hero placeholder above with a high-resolution screenshot (recommended) at `images/banners/hero.png`.

## Why this project

This repository demonstrates a client-ready front-end experience with:

- Clear product presentation and conversion-focused layout
- Fast, dependency-free deliverable (no build step required)
- Accessible components and semantic markup for inclusive experiences
- Extensible structure for easy backend integration (APIs, serverless)

Use this repo as a portfolio piece, a launchpad for production, or a reference implementation for front-end best practices.

---

## What you'll find here

- Landing page with hero, featured collections, and CTA.
- Product listing pages (grid, filters, quick-view pattern).
- Client-side cart with add/remove and totals (`js/cart.js`).
- Theme toggling helpers (`js/theme.js`) and auth UI placeholders (`pages/*`, `css/auth.css`).
- Styles scoped in `css/` with a dedicated `responsive.css` for breakpoints.

---

## Tech stack & architecture

- HTML5 (semantic)
- CSS3 (vanilla; organized for tokens and theme variables)
- JavaScript (ES modules, vanilla)
- Optional: Tailwind / DaisyUI ready for integration if you prefer utility-first styling

Architecture notes

- Static files render the UI; `js/products.js` currently provides product data locally.
- To go dynamic: replace `products.js` data with fetch calls to an API endpoint or headless CMS.
- Cart persistence uses `localStorage` as a demo; move to server-side sessions for production security.

---

## Quick start (PowerShell)

1. Clone repository

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Kawser420/project2.git
cd project2
```

2. Serve the site locally (one of the options above). Example using Python:

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
```

3. Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

Optional: install `Live Server` in VS Code for live reload while editing.

## Folder structure

```
project2/
├─ index.html
├─ pages/
├─ css/
│  ├─ style.css
│  ├─ responsive.css
│  └─ auth.css
├─ js/
│  ├─ products.js
│  ├─ cart.js
│  ├─ auth.js
│  └─ theme.js
├─ images/
│  ├─ banners/
│  ├─ icons/
│  └─ products/
└─ README.md
```

Key files:

- `index.html` — main landing page
- `pages/shop.html` — product listing
- `js/cart.js` — cart logic and UI hooks

---

## Customization examples

- Replace product data with an API call in `js/products.js`:

```javascript
// fetch products from a headless CMS or REST API
async function loadProducts() {
  const resp = await fetch("/api/products");
  const products = await resp.json();
  renderProducts(products);
}
```

- Change brand color in `css/style.css` (CSS variables):

```css
:root {
  --brand-primary: #0b5cff;
}
```

---

## Deployment & CI recommendations

For a production-looking demo, deploy to Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

- Netlify: connect the repo and deploy. Use Netlify Functions for serverless endpoints.
- Vercel: instant static deployments with serverless function support.
- GitHub Pages: good for simple demos; add a `gh-pages` branch or use Actions to deploy.

CI tip: Add a lightweight GitHub Action to validate HTML/CSS and deploy to your chosen host. I can scaffold a `deploy.yml` action that runs on push to `main` and deploys to GitHub Pages or Netlify.

---

## Accessibility & performance

- Semantic markup, keyboard focus styles, and ARIA attributes where necessary.
- Images use `loading="lazy"` and explicit dimensions for layout stability.
- Performance targets: LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1. Keep JS payloads minimal.

## Contributing

If you'd like to collaborate or accept contributions:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a topic branch (`feature/` or `fix/`)
3. Open a pull request and include screenshots and a short test plan

I can add `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` if you want a polished contributor experience.

---

## License & contact

This project is available under the MIT License. Add a `LICENSE` file to the repo root (I can create one for you).

For client inquiries or professional work, please link to your GitHub profile or add a business email here. Example: `hello@yourdomain.com`.

---

If you want, I will:

- Add a large hero screenshot and product screenshots to `README.md` for visual impact.
- Create a `LICENSE` file (MIT) and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Scaffold a GitHub Actions workflow to publish to GitHub Pages automatically.

Tell me which of those to do next and I will implement it.
